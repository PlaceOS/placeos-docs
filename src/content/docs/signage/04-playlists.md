When creating a playlist you can define things like:
- Playlist shuffled: randomizes the playlist items at playback time, Select this if order doesnâ€™t matter.
- Default play time: i.e. 15 seconds. This is the default time period images are displayed before moving to the next item.
- Orientation: Landscape, portrait, square. The target orientation - when added to zones, only displays with matching orientation will pick up the playlists.
- Animation: this is the default animation between items in the playlist
- Valid from, Valid until: Dates to start presenting and stop presenting this playlist. Good for time limited promotions / campaigns.
