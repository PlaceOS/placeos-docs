Below is a list of high level functions that PlaceOS is capable of and the technical requirements for each.

<!-- Can rearrange as a table if needed -->

### Log in with SSO
Users can log on using existing enterprise credentials. 
They do not need to “sign up” nor remember a new user account/password.  

**Requirement**   
Integration with enterprise identity providers via SAML2 or OAuth2. 
Examples:
- Azure AD Enterprise Application
- AD FS
- Google Workspace (GSuite) authentication

PlaceOS web apps are able to search and book room & user Calendars from the enterprise directory. 
Enterprise directories include Office 365, Exchange Online, Google Workspace (GSuite) etc.  

**Requirement**  
Office 365/Exchange Online or Google Calendar: 
- Integration with Microsoft Graph API via an Azure “Registered App”
- All required Calendars and Users must be accessible via MS Graph API *or* Google Calendar API if users are on GSuitexs

### Show or use sensor data
PlaceOS web apps or analytics are able to show or track live sensor data, such as:
- Desk occupancy
- In-room people count
- Air quality 

**Requirement**   
- Compatible PlaceOS Driver for the integration (device/service)
- Network connectivity to the Cisco DNA Spaces integration or its gateway

### Control devices 
PlaceOS web apps or automations are able to send messages to edge devices over the network.
These can control integrations or receive live status information.

**Requirement**  
- Compatible PlaceOS Driver for the integration (device/service)
- Network connectivity to the integration or its gateway

### Locate Devices
If a user's device (such as phone or laptop) is online, PlaceOS will be able to locate it within the building.
This infers a user's location and the distribution/density of people.

**Requirement**  
Locations services such as:
- Cisco DNA Spaces
- Cisco Meraki RTLS
- HP Aruba

### Analytics for connected integrations 
PlaceOS provides live and retrospective data for all connected integrations. 
An analytics dashboard enables insights.

**Requirement**  
PlaceAnalytics API

*[AD FS]: Active Directory Federation Services  
*[RTLS]: Real-Time Location Services
