title: Supported Integrations
description: Devices and services which are ready to integrate with PlaceOS
---

<!-- Do not remove deprecated integrations, move them to the last category. Jon's request. -->

PlaceOS has a range of pre-built drivers for integrating with third party services and devices. 
Drivers are written in [Crystal Lang](https://crystal-lang.org/) and based on our [Framework](https://github.com/PlaceOS/driver).
<!-- consider the explain page for Crystal Lang -->

If a driver for your device is not available, you can raise a request to have the driver written via our Service Desk.
Or, you can refer to the [How to Write A Driver](../tutorial/backend/write-a-driver) guide to write your own.
