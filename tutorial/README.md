Tutorials are _lessons_ that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind.
They should show a beginner that they can achieve something with a new tool or concept.

They are wholly **learning-oriented**.

You are the teacher, and you are responsible for what the student will do.
Under your instruction, the student will follow a series of actions to achieve some end.
The end has to be meaningful, but also achievable for a complete beginner.

The important thing is that having done the tutorial, the learner is in a position to make sense of the rest of the documentation.
