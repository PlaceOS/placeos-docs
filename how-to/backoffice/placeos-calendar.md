description: How to Configure the Calendar Driver on PlaceOS
---

The PlaceOS Calendar Driver connects to Microsoft Graph API (365) or Google Workspace.

The Calendar Driver and the [Bookings Driver](./placeos-bookings.md) work together to get resource calendar events.

The Calendar Driver can also make ad-hoc bookings from kiosks or room booking panels.

## Prerequisites 

- Administrator access to your PlaceOS Backoffice
- PlaceOS Drivers Repository Configured in Backoffice
- Systems have a valid calendar resource address from Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace
<!-- TODO Link to Add Respository Doc after Merge -->

## Add Driver

Before we can use the PlaceOS Calendar Driver we must instantiate it as a driver.

1. Navigate to the Drivers tab
2. Click the `+` icon to add a new driver
3. Select `PlaceOS Drivers` Repository
4. Select the `drivers > place > calendar.cr` Driver Base
5. Select the latest commit
6. Click Save

## Add to System

You need to instantiate a single instance of the PlaceOS Calendar Driver.

We recommend instantiating the driver in a generic system e.g. `*Tracking`.

That module is then added to each system that requires booking or calendar functionality.

### Instantiate the Driver

1. Navigate to the system you will instantiate the driver in
2. Select the `Modules` tab
3. Click `Add New`
   ![Add Calendar Driver](./assets/add-driver.png)
4. Search for the PlaceOS Calendar driver
   ![Search for Driver](./assets/search-for-driver.png)
5. Click Save
   ![Save Calendar Driver](./assets/save-cal-driver.png)
6. Enable the driver by clicking the black dot, it should turn green
   ![Start Calendar Driver](./assets/driver-started.png)

### Configure Driver

:::tip
For Google Integration, we recommend creating a Service User on Google Workspace.

Service Users are the same as a regular Users Accounts with a descriptive name e.g. `placeos-service-user@yourdomain.com`

For testing, you can use your own Google Workspace Account.
:::

The driver is now instantiated as a module, we need to configure the API Credentials.
<!-- TODO these steps will need review pending GH Issues -->
1. Navigate to the Drivers tab
2. Select the Calendar Driver
3. In the Settings view select `unencrypted` tab
4. Delete all the example configuration provided by the driver
5. If using Google Calendar API, paste this configuration into the `encrypted` tab:
   ```yaml
   calendar_config:
         scopes:      ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly"],
         domain:      "primary.domain.com", #Your Google Workspace Domain
         sub:         "default.service.account@google.com", # User or Service User Account
         issuer:      "placeos@organisation.iam.gserviceaccount.com", # client_id from the JSON
         signing_key: "PEM encoded private key" # private_key from the JSON
   ```
6. If using Office 365, paste this configuration into the `encrypted` tab:
   ```yaml
   calendar_config:
         tenant:          "",
         client_id:       "",
         client_secret:   "",
         conference_type: nil # This can be set to "teamsForBusiness" to add a Teams link to EVERY created Event
   ```
7. Enter your API information for Microsoft Azure or Google Workspace replacing placeholder text

### Add Module to Systems

You can now add the module to other systems as required.

1. Navigate to an existing system
2. Select the `Modules` tab
3. From the drop down, select the Calendar Module
4. Click `Add Existing`
   ![Add Existing Driver](./assets/add-existing.png)

## Test Module

You can test by creating a booking or inspecting the state of the Calendar Driver.

Inspecting State should return a valid response.

![Inspect State](./assets/inspect-state.png)

This should return:
```yaml
{
    "connected": true
}
```

You can also execute a function on the module and view the response.

As a test, executing the `list_users` function should return a list of users if connected properly.
