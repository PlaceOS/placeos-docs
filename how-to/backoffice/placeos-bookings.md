description: How to Configure the Bookings Driver on PlaceOS
---

The primary purpose of the Bookings Driver is to enable room booking panels, kiosks and space maps.

Best practice is to add the Bookings Driver to every system on PlaceOS that supports room booking.

## Prerequisites 

- Administrator access to your PlaceOS Backoffice
- PlaceOS Drivers Repository Configured in Backoffice 
- Systems have a valid calendar resource address from Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace

## Add to Systems

You need to instantiate a single instance of the PlaceOS Bookings Driver in each system that has a bookable space.

1. Navigate to a bookable system
2. Select the `Modules` tab
3. Click `Add New`
4. Select `PlaceOS Bookings`

5. Click Save

6. Click the Black Dot next to the Module to start it

## Test Module

You can test by creating a booking and inspecting the state of the Bookings Driver.

Inspecting the state will return a JSON response of all bookings for that systems calendar resource.

In the example below, you will see a positive response with a calendar booking.
