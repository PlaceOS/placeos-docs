PlaceOS supports publishing module state information via MQTT. 
This provides environment information to external systems such as [Amazon MQTT Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/view-mqtt-messages.html)

MQTT messages consist of a *header* and a *payload* and typically have low bandwidth usage. 
The header declares the topic of the message, and the payload carries data as key-value pairs.
PlaceOS uses two types of message sent over MQTT: State Changes and Metadata.

## State Change
Changes to module state propagate in real time. 
All change messages share the following topic structure:

```markup
placeos/<org>/state/<bld>/<lvl>/<area>/<sys>/<drv>/<mod>/<idx>/<state>
```
In this structure, each section is a unique identifying tag to represent part of the system.
- `<org>`: Organization ID
- `<bld>`: [Building](../overview/zones.md) ID
- `<lvl>`: [Level](../overview/zones.md) ID
- `<area>`: [Area](../overview/zones.md) ID
- `<sys>`: [System](../overview/systems.md) ID
- `<drv>`: [Driver](../overview/drivers.md) ID
- `<mod>`: [Module](../overview/modules.md) ID
- `<idx>`: Module Index
- `<state>`: State Key


<!--What part of PlaceOS? messaging service? Does this microservice (?) have a title? -->
On a state change, the module will publish a message with the payload containing the new state value as a JSON entity. 
The associated driver defines the structure and frequency of this state change.

Some systems may not have a building, level, or area.
If they generate a state change, the missing topic level will be an underscore character (`_`).

### State Change Payload
The *payload* is the value of the status variable paired with a timestamp
```json
{
  "time": unix_integer_milliseconds,
  "value": "payload is a serialized json string"
}
```
## Metadata
Metadata is available for *building*, *level*, *area*, *system* and *driver* tiers. 
The format is this persistent topic:

```markup
placeos/<org>/metadata/<id>
```

### Metadata Payloads

Metadata payloads are JSON objects that contain model info for the publishing entity. 
This includes the human-readable "friendly name", e.g.

```json
{
  "name": "Cisco VC"
}
```
```json
{
  "name": "Level 24"
}
```



## Wildcard Subscriptions
Wildcards can replace any topic level to catch state information across different services. 
Some common examples are:

All events within a building: 
```markup
placeos/<org>/state/<bld>/# 
```

Connected status of all devices:
```markup
placeos/<org>/state/+/+/+/+/+/+/+/connected 
```
Power status for all displays:
```markup
placeos/<org>/state/+/+/+/+/+/Display/+/power
```
Call status information for Cisco VC endpoints (`dep-123` is the driver ID for Cisco VC):
```markup
placeos/<org>/state/+/+/+/+/dep-123/+/+/call_status
```

## Privacy
Some deployment requirements may include filtering of sensitive information.
The system parses state changes for content such as email addresses or user IDs before they propagate.
A match can lead to actions such as:
- Replacing the value with a hashed version of itself
- Masking the value 
- Dropping the associated event

## Cloud Brokers
PlaceOS can integrate with MQTT Brokers including the major service providers listed below.

<!-- Ideally link each logo to each provider? Old doc has the logos as separate images too -->
