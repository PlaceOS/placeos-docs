# Configure PlaceOS for Google Workspace

These steps will help Google Cloud & Google Workspace Administrators make the necessary configurations for PlaceOS User Authentication via Google Workspace (Federated Authentication) and Calendar Visualisation for PlaceOS Room Booking.

If your PlaceOS will have room booking enabled, you will need to complete the Calendar Access steps.
