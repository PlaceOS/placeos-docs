  Steps required to successfully configure and integrate the PlaceOS Platform
  into Microsoft 365 for user authentication and room booking with delegated
  access.

# Configure PlaceOS for Microsoft 365 (Delegated)

{% hint style="warning" %}
These instructions are for delegated access, under delegated access some restrictions are imposed on the Concierge Application - most notably the ability to edit user calendar bookings is removed. All other functionality such as viewing scheduled meetings and catering is retained.
{% endhint %}

These steps will help Azure Administrators make the necessary configurations for PlaceOS User Authentication via Microsoft Active Directory (Federated Authentication) and Calendar Visualisation for PlaceOS Room Booking.

If you only require User Authentication you do not need to complete the Calendar Access steps.

If your PlaceOS will have room booking enabled, you will need to complete the Calendar Access steps.
