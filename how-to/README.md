How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.

They are directions to achieve a specific end and are wholly **goal-oriented**.

How-to guides are distinct from [tutorials](../tutorial/):
- A tutorial is a lesson that explores a topic
- A how-to is an answer to a question, or a process to follow

In a how-to guide, you can assume base level knowledge, tooling familiarity and understanding.
