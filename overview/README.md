Explanations _clarify and illuminate a particular topic_.
They broaden the documentation’s coverage of a topic.

They are **understanding-oriented**.

Explanations may take the form of discussions; they are discursive in nature.
They are a chance for the documentation to provide a higher level view, even from different perspectives.
You might imagine a document here read at leisure, rather than over the code.

A topic is not defined by a specific task you want to achieve, like a [how-to](../how-to/) guide, or what you want the user to learn, like a [tutorial](../tutorial/).
It’s not defined by a piece of the machinery, like [reference](../reference/) material.
It should instead provide a standalone explanation of a particular subject of relevance.
