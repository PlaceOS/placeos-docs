<!-- # Systems -->

A *system* is the main logical building blocks within PlaceOS. 
They contain three components:
- A collection of [modules](modules.md)
- [Settings](settings.md) which will apply to the system and modules in it
- Basic metadata (name, description etc)

## Purpose

Systems often represent physical spaces, such as meeting rooms.
They can also represent connected items which run across physical spaces, such as a range of digital signage. 
Otherwise, they can represent a non-physical system with data inputs and outputs, such as a payment portal.

## Systems and Zones

[Zones](zones.md) are groups of systems which can reflect their physical or conceptual groupings.
Systems can belong to zero or more zones.
