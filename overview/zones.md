<!-- # Zones -->

_Zones_ are collections of [systems](systems.md). 
A system can have tags marking it as a member of any number of zones.

<!-- ![Zones have settings and a collection of systems.](../.gitbook/assets/concepts-zone.svg) -->

## Purpose
They serve two main purposes:

1. Logical groupings of systems with common traits, generally:
   - Those in the same physical space, but at a larger scale than systems. 
   For example, if each system is a room then the building would be a zone
   - Systems of the same general concept.
   For example if you have customer-facing systems zoned separately to internal systems 
1. A point to define [settings](settings.md) that need to affect a set of systems in the same way
