Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:

* Have a syntax like Ruby (but compatibility with Ruby is not a goal)
* Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments
* Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal
* Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code
* Compile to efficient native code

## Why Crystal

Security: we can distribute a single static binary in a docker container, there is little chance of exploit.

Speed: the binaries are fast, see [Spider-Gazelle](#spider-gazelle).

Developer happiness: all the benefits of Go Lang with the elegance of Ruby.
