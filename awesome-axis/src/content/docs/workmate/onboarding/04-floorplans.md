If your PlaceOS Workmate Deployment requires Floor Plans, we will require copies of PDF, JPG, PNG or DWG Floor Plans of your office space. It is preferable these files are high resolution or easy to read.

It is best to clearly mark the floor plans, if not already, with the following information:
- Points of interest including photocopiers, print stations, kitchen, bathrooms etc.
- Clearly labelled Rooms with Room Names that match your Room Resources or appear as you would want the end users to see them in the application.
- Clearly numbered desks where desk booking will be implemented.
- Indication of any zone overlays or neighbourhoods that may be present.

You may provide all the above information annotated on a single floor plan or provide multiple copies of the same floor plan for each purpose.

If resources are available, you can also draw your own floor plans by following [these instructions.](/how-to/user-interfaces/svg-map-creation)
