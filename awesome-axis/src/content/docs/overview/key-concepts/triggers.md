<!-- # Triggers -->

*Triggers* provide a way to dynamically link state and behavior across different modules.
They define actions that will occur based on certain criteria, such as:
- System state
- Time
- External input such as a webhook

## Customization

Triggers permit modules to influence the behavior of other modules directly. 
In PlaceOS Backoffice, users can create, assign and manage triggers.
This way, they can customize extensive event driven behavior. 
That accompanies more complex core system behavior written in the logic [modules](modules.md).
